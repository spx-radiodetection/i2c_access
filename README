I2C_ACCESS
==========

This is a small utility for providing access to the i2c interface.

i2c-tools is SMBus specific where I2C transactions are assumed to be register based.

This utility allows raw i2c reads and writes, and optionally combining into two concatenated 
transactions.


    user@rd-imx6:~# i2c_access --help
    Usage:
      i2c_access [OPTION...] <i2c-dev-node> <addr> [byte0 [byte1 [...]]]

    Performs simple reads and writes to 7bit i2c addresses.

    Help Options:
      -h, --help                Show help options

    Application Options:
      --version                 output version
      -v, --verbose             print what is happening
      --dry-run                 don't execute
      -r, --read=bytes2read     perform i2c read (in bytes)
      -f, --force               access i2c devices controlled by a driver

    Examples:
      i2c_access /dev/i2c-0 0x2b 1 184 255     # i2c write of 1 184 255 to 0x2b on /dev/i2c-0
      i2c_access /dev/i2c-0 0x68 3 -r 1 -f     # i2c write of 3 to 0x68, follow by 1 byte read, forced
      i2c_access /dev/i2c-0 0x29 -r 2          # i2c read of 2 bytes from 0x29
